# Project Brief: Card API

## Project Overview
Card API is a RESTful API built with TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Supabase authentication for a flashcard review application with spaced repetition.

## Core Requirements
- Provide backend services for a flashcard application
- Implement the Free Spaced Repetition System (FSRS) algorithm
- Support user authentication via Supabase
- Manage decks and cards with full CRUD operations
- Track review metrics and enforce daily review limits
- Support CSV import for bulk card creation
- Provide AI-powered content explanation

## Technical Stack
- TypeScript for type safety
- Express.js for API routing
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Supabase for authentication
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker for local development

## Main Features
- User authentication and management
- Deck and card management
- Spaced repetition system (FSRS algorithm)
- Daily review limits and tracking
- Detailed review metrics
- User-specific settings
- CSV import for bulk card creation
- AI-powered content explanation

## Project Goals
1. Create a robust backend for flashcard management
2. Implement scientifically-backed spaced repetition algorithms
3. Provide a clean, well-documented API for frontend integration
4. Support efficient learning through optimized review scheduling
5. Enable customization through user settings

## Timeline
This is an ongoing development project with continuous improvements and feature additions.

## Deliverables
