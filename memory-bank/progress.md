# Progress

## What Works
Based on project documentation, the following features appear to be implemented:

- Core API structure and architecture
- Authentication using Supabase
- RESTful API endpoints for decks and cards
- FSRS algorithm implementation
- User settings management
- CSV import functionality
- AI-powered content explanation
- Local development environment with Supabase

## What's Left to Build
Without a detailed review of the codebase, it's difficult to determine exactly what remains to be built. This section should be updated after a thorough code review.

Potential areas for further development:
- Enhanced testing coverage
- Performance optimizations for large card collections
- Additional analytics and reporting features
- Mobile-specific API optimizations
- Advanced import/export functionality
- Improved error handling and validation

## Current Status
The project appears to be in active development with a functional core feature set. The memory bank has been initialized to provide documentation and context for future development work.

### Implemented Features
- User authentication
- Deck management
- Card management
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Daily review limits
- User settings
- CSV imports
- AI-powered content explanation

### In Progress Features
To be determined after code review.

## Known Issues
No specific issues have been identified yet. This section should be updated after reviewing the codebase and any issue tracking systems.

Potential areas to investigate:
- Performance with large card collections
- Edge cases in the FSRS algorithm implementation
- CSV import handling of special characters or large files
- Concurrency handling for simultaneous operations

## Recent Achievements
- Initialized the memory bank documentation
- Documented the project's architecture and technical context

## Next Milestones
- Complete a thorough review of the codebase
- Update this progress document with accurate status information
- Identify and prioritize next development tasks
- Establish testing and quality assurance processes

## Performance Metrics
Performance metrics should be established and tracked, including:
- API response times
- Database query performance
- User learning effectiveness (card retention rates)
- System resource utilization

## User Feedback
No user feedback has been documented yet. This section should be updated as feedback is received.
