# Progress

## What Works
The following features are currently implemented and working:

- Core API structure and architecture
- Authentication using Supabase
- RESTful API endpoints for decks and cards
- FSRS algorithm implementation
- User settings management
- CSV import functionality
- AI-powered content explanation
- Local development environment with Supabase
- Application-level error handling with retry logic
- Database-level consistency functions for critical operations

## What's Left to Build
Based on recent development work, the following items remain to be addressed:

- Enhanced logging and monitoring for the system
- Metrics collection for usage patterns
- Improved overall system documentation
- Potential UI enhancements for better user experience
- Additional recovery mechanisms for edge cases

## Current Status
The project is in active development with recent focus on streamlining the core API functionality. We've removed the demo user management system to simplify the codebase and focus on essential features.

### Implemented Features
- User authentication
- Deck management
- Card management
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Daily review limits
- User settings
- CSV imports
- AI-powered content explanation
- SQL-level safeguards for critical functionality

### In Progress Features
- Enhanced monitoring for the system
- Metrics collection for user activity
- Refinements to error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Known Issues
- Race condition between user creation and settings initialization (addressed with retry logic)
- Settings persistence issues for some users (addressed with SQL-level functions)
- NODE_ENV not being properly set during Vercel deployments (fixed with environment handling improvements)

## Recent Achievements
- Removed the demo user management system
- Simplified the codebase for better maintainability
- Updated documentation to reflect the current system architecture
- Improved error handling with comprehensive retry logic
- Fixed environment handling issues in the Vercel deployment process
- Added SQL functions to ensure settings consistency
- Enhanced deployment process

## Next Milestones
- Complete verification of core functionality in production
- Implement enhanced logging and monitoring
- Develop metrics collection for user activity
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Review remaining deployment scripts for further optimization

## Performance Metrics
We should establish and track the following metrics:
- API response times
- Card review submission rate
- Time required for user initialization
- Frequency of feature usage
- Most commonly used deck types
- Error rates in critical operations

## User Feedback
No specific user feedback has been collected yet. This should be a focus area once the core functionality is verified to be working correctly in production.
