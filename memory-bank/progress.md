# Progress

## What Works
The following features are currently implemented and working:

- Core API structure and architecture
- Authentication using Supabase
- RESTful API endpoints for decks and cards
- FSRS algorithm implementation
- User settings management
- CSV import functionality
- AI-powered content explanation
- Local development environment with Supabase
- Demo user automatic creation and content refresh
- Application-level error handling with retry logic
- Database-level consistency functions for critical operations

## What's Left to Build
Based on recent development work, the following items remain to be addressed:

- Enhanced logging and monitoring for the demo user service
- Metrics collection for demo user usage patterns
- Improved documentation for the demo user system
- Potential UI enhancements for the demo experience
- Additional recovery mechanisms for edge cases

## Current Status
The project is in active development with recent focus on the demo user management system. A new DemoService has been implemented to automatically create and manage demo users, ensuring they always have fresh content for demonstration purposes.

### Implemented Features
- User authentication
- Deck management
- Card management
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Daily review limits
- User settings
- CSV imports
- AI-powered content explanation
- Automated demo user management (new)
- Periodic content refreshing for demo users (new)
- SQL-level safeguards for critical functionality (new)

### In Progress Features
- Enhanced monitoring for the demo user system
- Metrics collection for demo user activity
- Refinements to error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Known Issues
- Race condition between user creation and settings initialization (addressed with retry logic)
- Settings persistence issues for demo users (addressed with SQL-level functions)
- NODE_ENV not being properly set during Vercel deployments (fixed with environment handling improvements)

## Recent Achievements
- Created a new DemoService that manages demo users automatically
- Implemented JSON templates for demo user settings and content
- Added polling mechanism for automatic demo content refreshing
- Removed manual demo user creation scripts from deployment process
- Improved error handling with comprehensive retry logic
- Fixed environment handling issues in the Vercel deployment process
- Added SQL functions to ensure settings consistency
- Updated deployment documentation to reflect the new approach

## Next Milestones
- Complete verification of demo user functionality in production
- Implement enhanced logging and monitoring
- Develop metrics collection for demo user activity
- Create comprehensive documentation for the demo user system
- Review remaining deployment scripts for further optimization

## Performance Metrics
We should establish and track the following metrics:
- Demo user content reset success rate
- Time required for demo user initialization
- Frequency of demo user access
- Most commonly used demo content
- Error rates in demo user operations

## User Feedback
No specific user feedback on the demo user system has been collected yet. This should be a focus area once the system is verified to be working correctly in production.
