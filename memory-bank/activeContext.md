# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing and fixing the automatic demo user management system. This involves creating a DemoService that handles both the creation and periodic resetting of demo users, ensuring they always have fresh content for demonstration purposes. We're also addressing issues with user settings persistence and improving error handling throughout the system.

## Recent Changes
- Created a new DemoService that automatically manages demo users
- Developed JSON template files for demo user settings and content
- Implemented polling mechanism for automatic content refreshing
- Removed manual demo user creation scripts from the deployment process
- Added SQL migration for ensuring demo user settings consistency
- Improved error handling and added retry logic for user creation and settings updates

## Next Steps
- Monitor the production deployment to ensure demo users are correctly initialized
- Verify that demo content resets are working as expected
- Consider additional improvements to logging to better diagnose issues
- Review remaining deployment scripts for further optimization
- Document the demo user system thoroughly for future developers

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Moved from script-based demo user creation to an automated service approach
- Implemented dual-layer verification for demo users (both auth metadata and user settings)
- Added SQL-level fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
- Ensured clear separation between development data seeding and production demo users

### Implementation Considerations
- Added comprehensive error handling with retries for all critical operations
- Implemented thorough logging throughout the DemoService
- Created JSON templates for better maintainability of demo content
- Designed the system to be self-healing with automatic detection and recovery
- Added database-level safeguards through SQL functions and scheduled jobs

### Feature Considerations
- Optimized demo user detection to check both metadata and settings tables
- Ensured demo users have appropriate default settings (dark theme, etc.)
- Designed content reset to be non-disruptive to the user experience
- Made the reset interval configurable through user metadata

## Documentation Priorities
- Update deployment documentation to reflect the new automated approach
- Document the DemoService architecture and behavior
- Create clear instructions for maintaining and updating demo content
- Ensure all administrative tools and commands are properly documented

## Current Questions
- Are there any edge cases in the demo user reset process that need handling?
- What additional monitoring might be helpful for the demo user system?
- Should we consider different reset intervals for different types of demo users?
- How can we gather metrics on demo user activity to improve the demonstration experience?
