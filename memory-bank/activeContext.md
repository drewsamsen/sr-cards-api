# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on streamlining the API and optimizing the core functionality. We've removed the demo user management system to simplify the codebase and focus on the essential features. We're also addressing issues with user settings persistence and improving error handling throughout the system.

## Recent Changes
- Removed the DemoService and related functionality
- Updated documentation to reflect the removal of demo user features
- Simplified deployment process
- Improved error handling with comprehensive retry logic
- Fixed environment handling issues in the Vercel deployment process

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring the production deployment for any issues
- Consider additional improvements to logging to better diagnose issues
- Review remaining deployment scripts for further optimization
- Enhance documentation for the core API functionalities
- Explore performance optimization opportunities

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Simplified the codebase by removing the demo user system
- Focused on the core API functionality
- Ensured clear separation between development data seeding and production
- Enhanced error handling throughout the system

### Implementation Considerations
- Added comprehensive error handling with retries for all critical operations
- Improved logging throughout the system
- Streamlined the codebase for better maintainability
- Designed the system to be robust with automatic detection and recovery
- Added database-level safeguards through SQL functions

### Feature Considerations
- Optimized user settings management
- Improved the FSRS algorithm implementation for better learning experience
- Enhanced the CSV import functionality
- Focused on the core API endpoints for better performance

## Documentation Priorities
- Update deployment documentation to reflect the simplified approach
- Enhance API endpoint documentation
- Create clear instructions for setting up development environment
- Ensure all administrative tools and commands are properly documented

## Current Questions
- What additional monitoring might be helpful for the system?
- How can we further optimize the FSRS algorithm for better learning outcomes?
- What performance metrics should we be tracking?
- How can we improve the user experience with additional API features?
