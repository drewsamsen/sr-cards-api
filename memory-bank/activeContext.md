# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initializing the memory bank for the Card API project. This involves documenting the project's key aspects, architecture, and progress to provide a comprehensive foundation for future development work.

## Recent Changes
- Created the memory bank structure
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context
- Established baseline documentation for the project

## Next Steps
- Review the codebase to understand the current implementation details
- Identify any gaps between documented architecture and actual implementation
- Document the current progress and status of the project
- Create a list of potential improvements or features to implement

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Supabase is used for authentication and database management
- The FSRS algorithm is implemented for spaced repetition scheduling

### Implementation Considerations
- Code quality and maintainability should be prioritized
- Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety
- Ensure proper error handling and validation throughout the API
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement comprehensive testing for critical components

### Feature Considerations
- Review the implementation of the FSRS algorithm for accuracy
- Evaluate the AI-powered explanation feature functionality
- Consider optimizations for CSV import processing
- Assess the user settings customization options

## Documentation Priorities
- Ensure all core files in the memory bank are complete and accurate
- Review and update API documentation if needed
- Document any complex business logic or algorithms
- Create additional context files for specific features if required

## Current Questions
- What is the current test coverage of the codebase?
- Are there any known issues or bugs that need to be addressed?
- What are the performance characteristics of the API with large card collections?
- How is the FSRS algorithm implementation validated for accuracy?
