# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The Card API project exists to provide a robust backend for flashcard applications that implement spaced repetition learning. It addresses the need for an efficient and scientifically-backed learning system that helps users retain information more effectively than traditional study methods.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Inefficient Learning**: Traditional study methods often lead to inefficient learning and quick forgetting. The FSRS algorithm optimizes review timing for better long-term retention.
2. **Study Organization**: Helps users organize their learning materials into decks and cards.
3. **Inconsistent Practice**: Enforces daily review limits to encourage consistent study habits and prevent burnout.
4. **Manual Content Creation**: Supports CSV import for easy bulk creation of flashcards.
5. **Limited Understanding**: Provides AI-powered explanations to help users understand difficult content.

## How It Should Work
The API should:
1. Authenticate users securely through Supabase
2. Allow users to create, read, update, and delete decks and cards
3. Schedule card reviews using the FSRS algorithm based on user performance
4. Track review metrics and enforce daily limits
5. Support user-specific settings for customization
6. Process CSV imports for bulk card creation
7. Provide AI-enhanced content explanations

## User Experience Goals
- **Efficiency**: Optimize the learning process through scientifically-backed spaced repetition
- **Simplicity**: Provide clean, intuitive API endpoints that are easy to integrate with
- **Flexibility**: Support customization through user settings
- **Reliability**: Ensure consistent and reliable API performance
- **Scalability**: Handle growing user bases and card collections efficiently
- **Enhancement**: Augment learning with AI-powered explanations and insights

## Target Users
The API is designed for:
1. **Developers**: Building flashcard applications that need a spaced repetition backend
2. **Students**: Learning various subjects efficiently through spaced repetition
3. **Lifelong Learners**: Maintaining knowledge in various domains
4. **Education Platforms**: Integrating spaced repetition into their offerings

## Success Metrics
The success of the Card API will be measured by:
1. API reliability and performance
2. User learning effectiveness (retention rates)
3. User engagement with the spaced repetition system
4. Ease of integration for developers
5. Scalability with growing user bases
